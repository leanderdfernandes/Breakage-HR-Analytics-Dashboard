## Psychometric Models

The application uses validated psychometric instruments:

### Job Embeddedness
- **Purpose**: Measures how embedded an employee is in their job and organization
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more embedded)
- **Impact**: Lower scores indicate higher attrition risk

### Perceived Organizational Support
- **Purpose**: Employee perception of organizational support and care
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more support)
- **Impact**: Lower scores indicate higher attrition risk

### Burnout (OLBI)
- **Purpose**: Measures emotional exhaustion and disengagement
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more burnout)
- **Impact**: Higher scores indicate higher attrition risk

### Job Satisfaction (MOAQ)
- **Purpose**: Overall job satisfaction and contentment
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more satisfied)
- **Impact**: Lower scores indicate higher attrition risk

### Psychological Safety
- **Purpose**: Perceived safety for interpersonal risk-taking
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more safety)
- **Impact**: Lower scores indicate higher attrition risk

### Work Engagement (UWES-9)
- **Purpose**: Vigor, dedication, and absorption in work
- **Scale**: 1-5 (higher = more engaged)
- **Impact**: Lower scores indicate higher attrition risk

## Risk Calculation

The overall attrition risk score (0-100) is calculated using weighted averages:

- **Job Embeddedness**: 25% weight
- **Perceived Organizational Support**: 20% weight
- **Burnout**: 25% weight
- **Job Satisfaction**: 20% weight
- **Psychological Safety**: 5% weight
- **Work Engagement**: 5% weight

### Risk Levels

- **Moderate Risk**: 31-70% (Yellow)
- **High Risk**: 71-100% (Red)
